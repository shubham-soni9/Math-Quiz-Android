In doing so,<br />\nthey are mentally decomposing 68 and calculating</p>\n\n<p>68 &minus; 5 = 60 + (8 &minus; 5) = 63</p>\n\n<p>Decomposition is a basic component of all subtraction algorithms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Single digit subtraction with change to &lsquo;columns&rsquo;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Students should be asked to consider calculations such as 62 &minus; 5 = 57 and be encouraged<br />\nto perform the subtraction in different ways, including:</p>\n\n<p>Counting backwards and keeping track of the steps.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For example, </strong>57&nbsp; 58&nbsp; 59&nbsp; 60&nbsp; 61&nbsp; 62</p>\n\n<p><strong>Breaking the number apart into manageable steps.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For example, 62 &minus; 5 = 62 &minus; 2 &minus; 3 = 60 &minus; 3 = 57</p>\n\n<p><strong>A different decomposition.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Would be, 62 &minus; 5 = 50 + (12 &minus; 5) = 57</p>\n\n<p><strong>Subtraction by equal addition</strong></p>\n\n<p>The principle of equal addition is the observation that if you add the same amount to two numbers, their difference does not change.</p>\n\n<p>In the example, 37 &minus; 18 = 39 &minus; 20 = 19, we have added 2 to both 37 and 18 to make the calculation easier.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the principle of equal addition also tells us that if you subtract the same amount from two numbers their difference doesn&rsquo;t change.

If the Sum of all numbers is divisible by 3 then the number is divisible by 3. Example:(8+6+1) = 15 and 15 is divisible by 3, So the 861 is divisible by 3. Some more Example: 22104/3 = 7368. (2+2+1+0+4) = 9. 9/3 = 3, So 22104 divisible by 3.</p>\n\n<p>3. The number is Divisible by 4 when the end of two digit is divisible by 4 or end of two digit is Zero. Example: 85736 = 21434. (End two digit divisible by 4). 98300 = 24575 (End of both digit is Zero).</p>\n\n<p>4. The number is end with Zero or 5 Then the number is divisible by 5. Example: 7775/5 = 1555 (End digit is 5), 3390/5 = 678 (End digit is 0).</p>\n\n<p>5. The number is divisible by 6 when the number is divisible by 3 and 2. So both the condition should be satisfied by Rule 3 and 2 otherwise number will be not divisible by 6. 5844/6 = 974 (Both condition are satisfied).</p>\n\n<p>6. Three end digit of number if divisible by 8 and if the last three digit is Zero then the number is also divisible by 8. Example:224256/8=28032 here the last digit 256 is divisible by 8 so the total number should be divisible by 8. 92045000/8=11505625.last three digit is Zero so the number is divisible by 8.</p>\n\n<p>7. All digits sum of a number if divisible by 9 then the number is divisible by 9. Example: 9522:(9+5+2+2)=18 that is divisible by 9 so the number 9522/9=1058.</p>\n\n<p>8. The number is divisible by 10 if the number is end with Zero then the number divisible by 10. Example: 4790/10=479 and 1250/10=125 this two numbers are end with Zero that why it is divisible by 10.</p>\n\n<p>9. Using 11 a number is divisible if difference sum of Even places and sum of odd places is Zero so divisible by 11. Example: 1236431460/11=112402860. (1+3+4+1+6)(odd places)-(2+6+3+4+0)(Even places)=0 and sum of odd and Even digit is equal so the number is divisible by 11.</p>\n\n<p>10. We can write 15 as (5&times;3) so if a number is divisible by 5 and 3 then the number is divisible by 15.</p>"

The perfect squares are the squares of the whole numbers such as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 so on and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Before learning the procedure, it is wise that the performer memorizes the squares of the numbers 1-10 which is very elementary.</p>\n\n<p><br />\nTo extract the square root of any perfect square, follow the steps presented below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step-1</strong>:&nbsp; Look at the magnitude of the &ldquo;hundreds number&rdquo; (the numbers preceding the last two digits) and find the largest square that is equal to or less than the number. This is the 1<sup>st</sup>part of the answer.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step-2</strong>:&nbsp; Now, look at the last (unit&rsquo;s) digit of the number.

Therefore, the right digit of the answer must be the greater option which is 8.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, our final answer is 28.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s go for another example: <strong>&radic;3969 (square root of 3969)</strong></p>\n\n<p>\n1.

Since this method involves squaring the guess (multiplying the number times itself), <b>it uses the actual definition of square root</b>, and so can be very helpful in teaching the concept of square root.</p>\n\n<strong>Example: what is square root of 20?</strong>\n\n<p>You can start out by noting that since &radic;16 = 4 and &radic;25 = 5, then &radic;20 must be between 4 and 5.</p>\n\n<p>Then make a guess for &radic;20; let&#39;s say for example that it is 4.5. Square that, see if the result is over or under 20, and improve your guess based on that. Repeat this process until you have the desired accuracy (amount of decimals). It&#39;s that simple and can be a nice experiment for students!</p>\n\n<strong>Example: Find &radic;6 to 4 decimal places</strong>\n\n<p>Since 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 and 3<sup>2</sup> = 9, we know that &radic;6 is between 2 and 3. Let&#39;s guess (or estimate) that it is 2.5. Squaring that we get 2.5<sup>2</sup> = 6.25. That&#39;s too high, so we reduce our estimate a little. Let&#39;s try 2.4 next. To find the square root of 6 to four decimal places we need to repeat this process until we have five decimals, and then we will round the result.</p>\n\nEstimate - Square of estimate - High/low\n\n2.4 - 5.76 - Too low\n\n2.45 - 6.0025 - Too high but real close\n\n2.449 - 5.997601 - Too low\n\n2.4495 - 6.00005025 - Too high so the square root of 6 must be between 2.449 and 2.4495.\n\n2.4493 - 5.99907049 - Too low\n\n2.4494 - 5.99956036 - Too low, so the square root of 6 must be between 2.4494 and 2.4495\n\n2.44945 - 5.9998053025 - Too low, so the square root of 6 must be between 2.44945 and 2.4495.\n\nThis is enough iterations since we know now that √6 would be rounded to 2.4495 (and not to 2.4494).\n\n<strong>Finding square roots using an algorithm</strong>\n\nThere is also an algorithm for square roots that resembles the long division algorithm, and it was taught in schools in days before calculators. See the example below to learn it. While learning this algorithm may not be necessary in today's world with calculators, working out some examples can be used as an exercise in basic operations for middle school students, and studying the logic behind it can be a good thinking exercise for high school students.\n\n<h3><strong>Example: Find &radic;<span style=\"text-decoration: overline\">645</span> to one decimal place.</strong></h3>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 5\">First group the numbers under the root in pairs from right to left, leaving either one or two digits on the left (6 in this case). For each pair of numbers you will get one digit in the square root.</p>\n\n<p>To start, find a number whose square is less than or equal to the first pair or first number, and write it above the square root line (2)</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup>&radic;6.45</p>"

We do it as follows :</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example :</strong> &radic;21.16</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To find the square root of a decimal number we put bars on the integral part (i.e., 21) of the number in the usual manner.And place bars on the decimal part (i.e., 16) on every pair of digits beginning with the first decimal place. Proceed as usual. We get 21.16 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2 </strong>:Now proceed in a similar manner. The left most bar is on 21 and 42 &lt; 21 &lt; 52. Take this number as the divisor and the number under the left-most bar as the dividend, i.e., 21. Divide and get the remainder.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>The remainder is 1. Write the number under the next bar (i.e., 16) to the right of this remainder, to get 116. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>:Add the divisor 2 and quotient 2 that gives us 4. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5 :</strong> Think of a largest number in fill in the blank in such a way that the product of a new divisor and this digit is equal to or less than 516(new dividend).</p>\n\n<p>Since 16 is the decimal part so put a decimal point in the quotient.</p>\n\n<p>In this case 86 &times; 6 = 516.</p>\n\n<p>As 86&times; 6 = 516 so we choose the new digit as 6.</p>\n\n<p>Get the remainder. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Step 6: Since the remainder is 0 and no bar left, therefore</p>\n\n<p>&radic;21.16 = 4.6</p>"
